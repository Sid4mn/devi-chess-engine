# devi Chess Engine

A chess engine written in Rust to understand chess engine algorithms, their history, and explore intuitive Rust implementations. This project focuses on learning core AI search algorithms while practicing clean Rust development patterns.

## Inspiration & Learning Resources
- **Book**: Chess Algo - Noah Caplinger - modern algorithmic approach to chess programming and search optimization
- **Book**: Computers, chess and long-range planning - M.M. Botvinnik - foundational theory on strategic planning and evaluation from a chess grandmaster's perspective
- Understanding the evolution of chess engines and classic algorithms
- Exploring how modern Rust can express these algorithms intuitively

## Features (planned)

### v0.1.0 - Playable Engine
- [ ] Board representation and move generation
- [ ] Basic material evaluation
- [ ] Simple minimax search (no alpha-beta yet)
- [ ] Basic GUI with egui
- [ ] Human vs Engine gameplay

### v0.2.0 - Engine Selector System
- [ ] Add alpha-beta pruning as "Engine v2"
- [ ] Engine selection menu in GUI
- [ ] Compare performance between engines
- [ ] Basic engine stats display

### v0.3.0 - Better Engines
- [ ] Add move ordering as "Engine v3"
- [ ] Add iterative deepening as "Engine v4"
- [ ] Engine difficulty selection

### v0.4.0 - Advanced Engines
- [ ] Transposition tables as "Engine v5"
- [ ] Positional evaluation as "Engine v6"

## Current Status
**v0.1.0 - In Development**

Currently working on core architecture and basic functionality.
